# Custom Gantt Components - Core Requirements

## 🎯 Overview
This document captures the **immutable requirements** for our custom Gantt components. These requirements are **non-negotiable** and must be satisfied regardless of architecture changes, implementation approaches, or development phases.

---

## 🔒 **CRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINTS**

### 1. **Day-Level Scheduling ONLY**
- ✅ **MUST**: Maximum hour-level granularity, NO minute/second precision
- ✅ **MUST**: All date calculations use day boundaries
- ✅ **MUST**: Timeline scales limited to: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter
- ✅ **MUST**: Duration format: "5d" or "8h" (no minutes/seconds)
- ✅ **MUST**: Dependency offsets in day units: "+3d", "-2d"

**Rationale**: Eliminates complexity while serving 99% of project management use cases

### 2. **No Batch Operations by Choice**
- ✅ **MUST**: Single-operation CRUD only (no batch editing)
- ✅ **MUST**: Immediate feedback for each action
- ✅ **MUST**: Real-time server synchronization (no batch mode)
- ✅ **MUST**: No bulk dependency creation
- ✅ **MUST**: No batch edit modes in grid

**Rationale**: Simpler UX, easier implementation, immediate feedback, reduced complexity

### 3. **Complete Control Over Implementation**
- ✅ **MUST**: No dependency on Syncfusion or other third-party Gantt libraries
- ✅ **MUST**: Full source code ownership and control
- ✅ **MUST**: Ability to customize every aspect of behavior and styling
- ✅ **MUST**: No "mysterious blackboxes" from external vendors

**Rationale**: Avoid vendor lock-in, eliminate debugging third-party issues
