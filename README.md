## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements custom Gantt UI components to replace third-party solutions like Syncfusion, providing:
- **Complete control** over component behavior and styling
- **Day-level scheduling** with hour-level granularity maximum
- **No batch operations** - single-operation CRUD with immediate feedback
- **Material Design** principles with CSS custom properties
- **Independent components** that work standalone or composed together

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **TaskGrid**: Data grid with hierarchical tree structure and editing capabilities ✅
- **TimelineView**: SVG-based timeline with task bars and dependencies ✅
- **GanttComposer**: Integration component for combined experience ✅ **BREAKTHROUGH ARCHITECTURE**

### Data Models
- **GanttTask**: Task entities with day-precision dates and duration
- **GanttResource**: Resource management with units and costs
- **GanttAssignment**: Task-resource assignments with work tracking

### Services
- **GanttRowAlignmentService**: Pixel-perfect row synchronization between components
