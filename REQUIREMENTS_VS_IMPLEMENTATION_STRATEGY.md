# Requirements vs Implementation Strategy

## 🎯 **Strategic Separation of Concerns**

This document explains the critical distinction between **immutable requirements** (REQUIREMENTS.md) and **experimental implementation** (basic_gantt_plan.md), and why this separation is essential for project success.

---

## 📋 **REQUIREMENTS.md = Immutable User Value**

### **Purpose**: The Contract with Stakeholders
- ✅ **What users actually need** (the "why" and "what")
- ✅ **Non-negotiable constraints** that define success
- ✅ **Measurable criteria** for acceptance
- ✅ **Stable foundation** that survives architecture changes
- ✅ **Contract with stakeholders** - these never change

### **Characteristics**:
- **Immutable during development** - requirements don't change mid-project
- **User-focused** - written from the perspective of user value
- **Technology-agnostic** - doesn't specify how to build, only what to build
- **Measurable** - clear success criteria and validation checkpoints
- **Complete** - captures all essential user needs

### **Content Structure**:
- **27 comprehensive sections** covering all user needs
- **Clear constraints** (day-level, UTC-only, no-batch operations)
- **Measurable targets** (1000+ rows, 60fps, <100KB bundle)
- **Non-negotiable boundaries** (what we will/won't do)
- **Success criteria** that anyone can validate

## 🧪 **basic_gantt_plan.md = Experimental Implementation**

### **Purpose**: The Developer's Laboratory
- 🧪 **How we might build it** (the "how")
- 🧪 **Technical exploration** and proof-of-concepts
- 🧪 **Iterative discovery** - expected to evolve
- 🧪 **Implementation details** that can be completely rewritten
- 🧪 **Developer's playground** - safe to experiment

### **Characteristics**:
- **Highly fluid** - implementation approaches will change
- **Technically-focused** - explores specific technologies and patterns
- **Experimental** - "let's try this and see" mentality
- **Disposable** - entire sections can be thrown away and rewritten
- **Learning-oriented** - documents discovery process

### **Content Nature**:
- **Multiple technical approaches** to explore
- **Proof-of-concept ideas** and prototyping plans
- **Architecture experiments** and technology evaluations
- **Implementation details** that will definitely evolve
- **"不确定性" (uncertainty)** - acknowledged and contained

## 🧠 **Why This Separation is Strategic Genius**

### **1. Risk Management**
```
Requirements (Stable) ←→ Implementation (Experimental)
      ↑                           ↑
 User needs never                Technical approaches
 change during                   can be completely
 development                     reimagined
```

**Benefits**:
- **Stakeholder confidence** - requirements won't change mid-project
- **Technical freedom** - developers can experiment without breaking commitments
- **Failure containment** - implementation failures don't affect user requirements
- **Clear accountability** - success is measured against stable criteria

### **2. Decision Framework**
```
When confused     → Go back to REQUIREMENTS.md
When stuck        → Revisit basic_gantt_plan.md  
When stakeholders → Show REQUIREMENTS.md
When developers   → Reference immutable constraints
```

**Benefits**:
- **Clear escalation path** for decision-making
- **Unified understanding** across team members
- **Conflict resolution** based on user value
- **Priority clarity** when resources are limited

### **3. Professional Development Process**
```
REQUIREMENTS.md (Contract) → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Validation
     ↑                                                                    ↓
     └─────────────── Feedback loop validates requirements ──────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- **Predictable delivery** - requirements define "done"
- **Quality assurance** - validation against stable criteria
- **Progress tracking** - measurable advancement toward goals
- **Risk mitigation** - implementation risk contained in experimental layer

---

## 💡 **Strategic Benefits**

### **For Development Team**:
- ✅ **Safe to fail fast** - implementation can be completely rewritten
- ✅ **Clear success metrics** - no ambiguity about what "done" means
- ✅ **Technical freedom** - experiment without breaking commitments
- ✅ **Learning opportunities** - documented experimentation process

### **For Project Management**:
- ✅ **Stable scope** - REQUIREMENTS.md is the unchanging contract
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - validate against requirements, not implementation details
- ✅ **Risk mitigation** - implementation risk is properly contained
- ✅ **Quality assurance** - requirements define clear acceptance criteria

### **For Stakeholders**:
- ✅ **Predictable delivery** - requirements won't change during development
- ✅ **Clear expectations** - measurable success criteria established upfront
- ✅ **Value focus** - development centers on user needs, not technical preferences
- ✅ **Quality confidence** - comprehensive validation checklist provided

## ⚙️ **Operational Guidelines**

### **When Working with REQUIREMENTS.md**:
- **Never modify** during active development
- **Reference frequently** for decision-making
- **Validate against** during testing
- **Use for stakeholder** communication

### **When Working with basic_gantt_plan.md**:
- **Experiment freely** with technical approaches
- **Update regularly** based on learnings
- **Document discoveries** and failed attempts
- **Maintain flexibility** for major changes

### **Decision-Making Process**:
1. **Check REQUIREMENTS.md** - Does this align with user needs?
2. **Consult basic_gantt_plan.md** - What technical approaches are we exploring?
3. **Validate impact** - Will this change affect requirements compliance?
4. **Document decision** - Update implementation plan with learnings
