## üìÖ **DELIVERY TIMELINE**

### **Sprint Schedule (7-day iterations)**
```
Week 1: v0.5.0 I18N Foundation    [NEXT - Ready to start]
Week 2: v0.6.0 Enhanced Timeline  [Timeline interactions]
Week 3: v0.7.0 Dependency System  [WBS-based dependencies] 
Week 4: v0.8.0 Resource Management [Assignment tracking]
Week 5: v0.9.0 Advanced Grid      [Professional grid features]
Week 6: v1.0.0 Export & Production [PDF export, final polish]
```

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
- **Daily merges** to main branch (no long-lived feature branches)
- **Small, independent** features that can ship individually
- **Requirements validation** at each milestone
- **Performance testing** throughout development
- **Fallback plans** for complex features (simplify vs delay)

## üîÑ **ITERATION PHILOSOPHY**

### **Daily Development Cycle**
1. **Morning**: Plan single feature scope (max 1 day work)
2. **Development**: Implement feature with requirements validation
3. **Testing**: Validate against requirements and user workflows  
4. **Integration**: Merge to main branch with automated validation
5. **Documentation**: Update progress and capture decisions

### **Weekly Milestone Cycle**
1. **Week Start**: Version planning and feature prioritization
2. **Daily Progress**: Feature implementation with daily merges
3. **Week End**: Version tagging and release documentation
4. **Retrospective**: Process improvement and risk assessment

### **Feature Validation Process**
- ‚úÖ **Requirements Check**: Does it satisfy specific REQUIREMENTS.md sections?
- ‚úÖ **User Workflow**: Can a project manager complete realistic tasks?
- ‚úÖ **Performance Test**: Smooth with 50+ tasks in current build?
- ‚úÖ **I18N Ready**: No hardcoded strings, proper localization hooks?
- ‚úÖ **Material Design**: Consistent with established visual patterns?

This plan prioritizes **working software delivery** over comprehensive feature sets, ensuring continuous value delivery while building toward the complete Gantt chart replacement.

## üìã **FEATURE DEPENDENCY MAPPING**

### **Core Foundation** (Must Be First)
1. **WBS Code System** ‚úÖ ‚Üí Enables all user-facing task identification
2. **I18N Foundation** üéØ ‚Üí Prevents hardcoded strings in all subsequent features  
3. **Row Alignment** ‚Üí Critical for timeline integration

### **User-Facing Features** (Build on Foundation)
4. **Enhanced Timeline** ‚Üí Visual project timeline with multiple zoom levels
5. **Dependency Management** ‚Üí Task relationship visualization and editing
6. **Resource Assignment** ‚Üí Resource allocation and utilization tracking
7. **Advanced Grid** ‚Üí Professional data management interface
8. **Export System** ‚Üí Project documentation and sharing

### **Quality Gates** (Throughout Development)
- **Performance**: Validated at each milestone with growing task counts
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance maintained from foundation
- **Material Design**: Consistent visual language across all features
- **Requirements**: Each feature validates against REQUIREMENTS.md sections

---

## üîÑ **LESSONS LEARNED & RATIONALE**

### **Why This Plan Works Better**
- **Requirements-First**: Every feature maps to specific requirement sections
- **Foundation-Up**: Core systems (WBS, I18N) established before building on them
- **Daily Iteration**: Small, independent features with daily merge cycles
- **User Value**: Each milestone delivers working functionality users can evaluate
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early validation prevents expensive late-stage refactoring

### **What We Avoid**
- ‚ùå **Technology Speculation**: No complex implementation details without proven need
- ‚ùå **Feature Creep**: Clear boundaries between essential and nice-to-have features  
- ‚ùå **Big Bang Integration**: Continuous working software from Week 1
- ‚ùå **Requirements Drift**: All features validated against REQUIREMENTS.md
- ‚ùå **Premature Optimization**: Focus on working features first, optimization second

**This plan ensures continuous delivery of working software while building systematically toward a complete Gantt chart replacement that satisfies all project requirements.**
