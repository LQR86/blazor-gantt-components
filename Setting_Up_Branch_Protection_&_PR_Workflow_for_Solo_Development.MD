## Setting_Up_Branch_Protection_&_PR_Workflow_for_Solo_Development

You're smart to practice proper PR workflow even solo! This builds good habits and shows professional practices to potential collaborators or employers.

## 🛡️ **Step 1: Enable Branch Protection**

### **Navigate to Repository Settings**
1. Go to: https://github.com/LQR86/blazor-gantt-components
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (next to Insights)
3. In left sidebar, click **"Branches"**

### **Protect Your Main Branch**
Click **"Add rule"** and configure:

````markdown
## 🔒 **Branch Protection Settings**

### **Branch name pattern**
```
main
```

### **Protect matching branches** ✅
- [x] Require a pull request before merging
  - [x] Require approvals: 0 (since you're solo)
  - [x] Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - [ ] Require review from code owners (skip for now)
  - [x] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB

### **Require status checks before merging** ✅  
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [x] Status checks required: Select your GitHub Actions workflows:
  - "CI/CD Pipeline"
  - "Feature Development" 

### **Require conversation resolution before merging** ✅
- [x] Require conversation resolution before merging

### **Other restrictions**
- [x] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
- [ ] Allow force pushes (keep disabled)
- [ ] Allow deletions (keep disabled)

### **Rules applied to everyone**
- [ ] Include administrators (leave unchecked so you can merge your own PRs)

## ⚙️ **Step 2: Update Repository Settings**

### **General Repository Settings**
In **Settings > General**:

````markdown
## 📋 **Pull Request Settings**
- [x] Allow merge commits
- [x] Allow squash merging (recommended for solo work)
- [x] Allow rebase merging  
- [x] Always suggest updating pull request branches
- [x] Allow auto-merge
- [x] Automatically delete head branches (cleans up after merge)

## 🔄 **Step 3: Solo PR Workflow**

### **Your New Development Process**

#### **1. Start Every Feature with a Branch**
````bash
# Never work directly on main anymore!
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/timeline-svg-rendering

# Work on your feature...
git add Components/TimelineView/
git commit -m "feat: Add SVG coordinate system for timeline"
git push -u origin feature/timeline-svg-rendering
````

#### **2. Create Pull Request**
After pushing your branch:
1. Go to GitHub - you'll see a banner: **"Compare & pull request"**
2. Click it and fill out a proper PR description:

````markdown
## 🎯 **Add SVG Timeline Rendering**

### **What This PR Does**
Implements the core SVG-based timeline rendering for the TimelineView component.

### **Changes Made**
- ✅ Created TimelineView.razor component structure
- ✅ Implemented day-to-pixel coordinate conversion
- ✅ Added SVG viewport setup with proper scaling
- ✅ Material Design CSS styling with CSS custom properties
- ✅ Component works standalone (tested in isolation)

### **Technical Details**
- Day-level precision maintained (no hour/minute granularity)
- SVG coordinate system: 40px per day
- Responsive width calculation based on date range
- CSS containment applied for performance

### **Testing Done**
- [x] Component renders without errors
- [x] Handles date ranges up to 1 year
- [x] Performance tested with 100+ elements
- [x] Material Design spacing verified

### **Files Changed**
```
Components/TimelineView/
├── TimelineView.razor      (+85 lines)
├── TimelineView.razor.cs   (+120 lines)
└── TimelineView.razor.css  (+45 lines)
```

### **Next Steps**
- Row alignment with TaskGrid component
- Task bar rendering
- Zoom level controls

### **Screenshots**
[Add screenshot of timeline SVG rendering]
````

#### **3. Self-Review Process** (Important!)
Even though you wrote the code, review it critically:

````markdown
## 🔍 **Self-Review Checklist**

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] Follows project conventions from copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] No console.log() statements left behind

🟡 Performance Monitoring: Daily performance tests
```

#### **5. Merge Your PR**
Once checks pass and you're satisfied with your self-review:
1. Click **"Squash and merge"** (recommended for solo work)
2. Edit the commit message if needed
3. Confirm merge
4. Delete the feature branch (GitHub will prompt you)

## 🎯 **Step 5: Practical Example Workflow**

### **Example: Adding TaskGrid Component**

#### **Day 1: Start the Feature**
````bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/task-grid-basic-structure

# Create the component files
mkdir -p Components/TaskGrid
touch Components/TaskGrid/TaskGrid.razor
touch Components/TaskGrid/TaskGrid.razor.cs  
touch Components/TaskGrid/TaskGrid.razor.css

# Basic structure implementation...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add TaskGrid component basic structure"
git push -u origin feature/task-grid-basic-structure
````

#### **Day 2: Continue Development**
````bash
# Still on feature/task-grid-basic-structure
# Add more functionality...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement CSS Grid layout for TaskGrid"
git push

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Material Design styling with CSS custom properties"
git push
````

#### **Day 3: Create PR**
1. Go to GitHub → **"Compare & pull request"**
2. Fill out the PR template thoroughly
3. **Self-review**: Look at every changed line critically
4. Wait for GitHub Actions to pass
5. **Merge**: Use "Squash and merge" to clean up history

#### **Clean Up**
````bash
git checkout main
git pull  # Gets your merged changes
git branch -d feature/task-grid-basic-structure  # Delete local branch
````

---

## 🛠️ **Step 6: Advanced Solo PR Techniques**

### **Draft PRs for Work in Progress**
````bash
# When you want to backup work but it's not ready
git push -u origin feature/timeline-interactions

# Create PR but mark it as "Draft"
# Add "WIP:" to title: "WIP: Add timeline interaction handlers"
````

### **Self-Code-Review Comments**
Leave comments on your own PR for documentation:
````markdown
💭 **Line 45**: Using CSS containment here for performance optimization

💭 **Line 78**: This calculation handles the day-to-pixel conversion - might need adjustment for different zoom levels

❓ **Line 120**: Consider whether this error handling is sufficient
````

### **PR Labels for Organization**
Create labels in **Issues > Labels**:
```
🎨 ui-component     # UI component work
🔧 core-logic       # Business logic
🐛 bug-fix          # Bug fixes  
📝 documentation    # Docs updates
⚡ performance      # Performance improvements
🧪 testing          # Test-related
```
