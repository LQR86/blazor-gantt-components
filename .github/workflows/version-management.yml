# DEPRECATED - Workflow Separation Complete
# 
# This workflow has been replaced by specialized workflows:
# - pr-validation.yml: Branch naming and PR title validation
# - milestone-validation.yml: Comprehensive milestone feature validation  
# - post-merge-automation.yml: Auto-tagging and release creation
# - core-build-test.yml: Basic build and test for all branches
# - hotfix-validation.yml: Fast security and critical path testing
# - docs-validation.yml: Documentation link checking and format validation
#
# Each workflow is optimized for specific branch types and purposes
# according to the Branch-Specific CI Strategy defined in
# BRANCH_SPECIFIC_CI_STRATEGY.md
#
# This file is kept for historical reference and will be removed
# once all workflows are validated.
