# Branch-Specific CI/CD Strategy

## Current Problem
All workflows run on every PR regardless of branch type, causing unnecessary CI runs and resource waste.

## Solution: Branch-Type Specific Workflows

### 1. **Core Build & Test (All Branches)**
- Runs on: All PRs (safety net)
- Purpose: Ensure code compiles and basic tests pass
- Duration: ~3-5 minutes

### 2. **Milestone Validation (feat/v* only)**
- Runs on: `feat/v*` branches only
- Purpose: Version validation, milestone requirements, comprehensive testing
- Duration: ~8-12 minutes

### 3. **Hotfix Validation (hotfix/* only)**
- Runs on: `hotfix/*` branches only
- Purpose: Security scanning, critical path testing, fast deployment validation
- Duration: ~2-3 minutes

### 4. **Documentation Validation (docs/* only)**
- Runs on: `docs/*` branches only
- Purpose: Link checking, spelling, format validation
- Duration: ~1-2 minutes

### 5. **Dependency Updates (chore/* only)**
- Runs on: `chore/*` branches only
- Purpose: Security scanning, vulnerability checks, license compliance
- Duration: ~5-7 minutes

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Add branch conditions to existing workflows
```yaml
# For build-and-test.yml - run on all branches
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    # No branch filtering - safety net for all PRs

# For version-management.yml - milestone features only
jobs:
  milestone-validation:
    if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'feat/v')
```

### Step 2: Create specialized workflows
- `hotfix-validation.yml` - Security and critical path testing
- `docs-validation.yml` - Documentation-specific checks
- `dependency-validation.yml` - Supply chain security

### Step 3: Optimize resource usage
- Skip expensive operations on non-code changes
- Use matrix builds only where necessary
- Cache aggressively for branch types

## Benefits
1. **⚡ Faster CI**: Only relevant checks run per branch type
2. **💰 Cost Reduction**: Fewer unnecessary workflow runs
3. **🎯 Focused Feedback**: Branch-specific validation messages
4. **🔒 Security**: Dedicated hotfix pipeline for urgent fixes
5. **📚 Quality**: Specialized validation for different change types

## Branch Type → Workflow Mapping

| Branch Type | Core Build | Milestone | Hotfix | Docs | Dependencies |
|-------------|------------|-----------|--------|------|--------------|
| `feat/v*`   | ✅         | ✅        | ❌     | ❌   | ❌           |
| `fix/*`     | ✅         | ❌        | ❌     | ❌   | ❌           |
| `hotfix/*`  | ✅         | ❌        | ✅     | ❌   | ❌           |
| `docs/*`    | ✅         | ❌        | ❌     | ✅   | ❌           |
| `chore/*`   | ✅         | ❌        | ❌     | ❌   | ✅           |
| `ci/*`      | ✅         | ❌        | ❌     | ❌   | ❌           |

This ensures every branch gets basic validation while specialized branches get appropriate deep validation.
